# Incident Response Runbook

## Overview
This runbook provides step-by-step procedures for handling incidents in the APM system, from detection through resolution and post-incident review.

## Incident Severity Levels

### P1 - Critical
- Complete system outage
- Data loss or corruption
- Security breach
- Customer-facing service completely unavailable

### P2 - High
- Major functionality degraded
- Performance significantly impacted
- Multiple users affected
- Non-critical data inconsistency

### P3 - Medium
- Minor functionality issues
- Limited user impact
- Performance slightly degraded
- Non-urgent bugs

### P4 - Low
- Cosmetic issues
- Documentation problems
- Enhancement requests
- Minor configuration issues

## Initial Response Procedure

### 1. Incident Detection
- Monitor alerts from monitoring systems
- Check dashboards for anomalies
- Review user reports and tickets
- Validate incident severity

### 2. Immediate Actions (First 5 minutes)
1. **Acknowledge the incident** in monitoring system
2. **Assess severity** using criteria above
3. **Create incident ticket** with:
   - Timestamp
   - Affected systems
   - Initial symptoms
   - Assigned severity level
4. **Notify stakeholders** based on escalation matrix

### 3. Investigation Phase
1. **Gather information**:
   - Check system logs
   - Review recent deployments
   - Analyze metrics and dashboards
   - Collect error messages

2. **Document findings**:
   - Update incident ticket
   - Create timeline of events
   - Note investigation steps taken

3. **Implement immediate workarounds** if available

## Resolution Procedures

### 1. Fix Implementation
1. **Identify root cause** through investigation
2. **Develop solution** with peer review
3. **Test fix** in staging environment
4. **Implement solution** with rollback plan
5. **Monitor system** for stability

### 2. Verification
1. **Confirm resolution** with monitoring
2. **Test affected functionality**
3. **Validate with stakeholders**
4. **Update incident status**

### 3. Communication
1. **Notify all stakeholders** of resolution
2. **Update public status page** if applicable
3. **Document final resolution** in ticket
4. **Schedule post-incident review**

## Post-Incident Review Process

### Timeline
- **Schedule review** within 24 hours of resolution
- **Conduct review** within 72 hours
- **Publish report** within 1 week

### Review Participants
- Incident commander
- All responders
- Engineering manager
- Product owner
- Any affected stakeholders

### Review Agenda
1. **Timeline review** (15 minutes)
   - Incident timeline
   - Response actions
   - Communication timeline

2. **Root cause analysis** (20 minutes)
   - What went wrong
   - Why it happened
   - Contributing factors

3. **Response evaluation** (15 minutes)
   - What went well
   - What could be improved
   - Communication effectiveness

4. **Action items** (10 minutes)
   - Preventive measures
   - Process improvements
   - Tool enhancements
   - Documentation updates

### Post-Review Actions
1. **Create action items** with owners and deadlines
2. **Update runbooks** based on lessons learned
